# BLOOP
An AXIOME3 visualization extension

# What is BLOOP?
BLOOP is an R and RShiny based extension to the AXIOME3-GUI pipeline. It is designed to allow users to quickly and efficiently visualize their amplicon datasets and produce near-publication-ready figures. Importantly, BLOOP provides users with a high level of interactivity and customization during figure generation. By seemlessly combining amplicon datasets with provided metadata, users can more readily explore and visualize microbial community compositional patterns.

# Usage summary
Because BLOOP is built using RShiny, users can simply clone this repository to any location on their local machine and execute it by running the server.R script in RStudio (after installing the appropriate packages, of course)
